# mini-book-search-engine
This is a mini search engine I coded that searches for words in a list of books, movies, or other media.

This implements more simpler versions of indexing, ranking, and query operations that bigger search engines like Google use. 
The user will be prompted to enter any word they would like and the program would then give a list of media that the word appears in according to their ratings. 
The user may also put in their own rating of any media they would like.
